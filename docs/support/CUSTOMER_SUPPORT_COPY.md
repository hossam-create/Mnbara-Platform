### Common clarification scenarios

**Item condition:**
"The listing showed the item as 'like new,' but you received something with more wear than expected. Photos can be tricky, and 'like new' means different things to different people."

**Delivery timeframe:**
"The estimated delivery was 7-10 days, but this was an estimate based on typical trips. Actual timing depends on traveler availability, which can vary."

**Fees:**
"The final amount was higher than the listing price because it included the traveler fee and service fee, which are shown during checkout."

**Item availability:**
"The traveler couldn't find the exact item you requested. Sometimes products are out of stock or discontinued in certain locations."
