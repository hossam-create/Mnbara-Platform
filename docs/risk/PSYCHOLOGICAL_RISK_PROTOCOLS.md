# PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK PROTOCOLS
## Founder Mental Guardrails & Cognitive Safety

**Classification:** OPERATIONAL — Leadership
**Status:** Advisory Protocol
**Target Audience:** Solo Founders / High-Stress Leadership

---

## 1. DECISION FATIGUE PROTECTION

### 1.1 The "Two-Decision" Rule
**Protocol:** A Founder will make no more than **TWO** "Type 1" (High Stakes / Irreversible) decisions in a single 24-hour period.

*   **Type 1 Decisions:** Pricing paradigm changes, hiring/firing executives, legal threats, public crisis statements.
*   **Type 2 Decisions:** UI tweaks, copy edits, routine bug fixes. (Unlimited)

**Why:** Cognitive decline after 2 major decisions reduces IQ-equivalent performance by ~15 points.

### 1.2 The "After 8 PM" Embargo
**Protocol:** No strategic decisions committed to writing or code after 8:00 PM local time.
*   *Action Permitted:* Drafting, brainstorming, reading.
*   *Action Prohibited:* Sending legal emails, deploying production code, authorizing large payments.

### 1.3 Review Deferral
**Protocol:** Any negative feedback, support crisis, or legal threat received >4 hours after start of day must be queued for the **next morning**.
*   **Why:** Evening cortisol spikes ruin sleep recovery, creating a compounding decision deficit for the next day.

## 2. THE "DO NOT RESPOND" PROTOCOLS

You are operationally prohibited from responding to external stimuli under these conditions:

### 2.1 The "Adrenaline" Lock
**Trigger:** Physical symptoms of stress (heart rate spike, shaking hands, heat in face).
**Protocol:**
1.  **Stop typing.**
2.  **Close the tab/window.**
3.  **Mandatory 45-minute lockout.** (Scientific minimum for cortisol/adrenaline washout).
4.  *Re-engage only after reviewing the draft with "Cold Eyes" (see below).*

### 2.2 The "Insult" Barrier
**Trigger:** Personal attack or questioning of integrity.
**Protocol:**
1.  **Do not defend.** Defense implies the attack has merit worth debating.
2.  **Route to "System".** Respond from a sterile "Support Team" alias/identity, referencing policy only.
3.  **Depersonalize.** Never use "I" or "Me". Use "The Platform" or "We".

### 2.3 The "Urgency" Trap
**Trigger:** Counterparty uses false urgency ("Reply within 1 hour or else...").
**Protocol:**
1.  **Assume Manipulation.** Artificial urgency is a standard manipulation tactic.
2.  **Delay Default.** Standard response: *"We have received your message and are reviewing it according to our standard procedures. We will reply within [Standard SLA]."*
3.  *Exception:* Actual server fires or verified legal service.

## 3. SAFE PAUSING MECHANISMS

How to stop without collapsing operations:

### 3.1 The "Ops Mode" Toggle
**Concept:** Shift from "Founder" (Creative/Strategic) to "Operator" (Mechanical).
**Protocol:** When overwhelmed, stop building. Switch to "Maintenance Only".
*   Only fix what breaks.
*   Only answer ticket backlog.
*   No new features. No new deals.
*   *Duration:* minimum 1 week.

### 3.2 The "Crisis Containment" Standard
**Protocol:** In a crisis (e.g., massive bug, user revolt), define the **"Stop Loss"** immediately.
*   *Action:* "We will revert to the last stable backup."
*   *Action:* "We will disable the feature."
*   *Action:* "We will refund everyone affected."
*   *Goal:* Cap the downside immediately so the brain stops calculating "infinite loss" scenarios.

### 3.3 The "Blackout" Window
**Protocol:** Mandatory 24-hour disconnected period every 7 days.
*   *Operational Setup:*
    *   Server monitoring alerts → SMS (Critical only).
    *   Support → Auto-response ("Limited weekend support").
    *   Email/Slack → Off/Deleted from phone.

## 4. COGNITIVE PROTECTION SCRIPTS

Use these to buy time without losing face:

*   **To Investors/Partners:** *"I'm currently heads-down on a critical critical production deployment. I will circle back to this on [Date + 3 days]."*
*   **To Angry Users:** *"I've escalated this to our technical review queue to get the logs. Expect an update in 24-48 hours."* (Even if you are the review queue).
*   **To Yourself:** *"This allows me to fight another day. Speed now = Error later."*

**Attestation:** Adoption of these guardrails is a fiduciary duty to the company. A burned-out founder is a single point of failure.
