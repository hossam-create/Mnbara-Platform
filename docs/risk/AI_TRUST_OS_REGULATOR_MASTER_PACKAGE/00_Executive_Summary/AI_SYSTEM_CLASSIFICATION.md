# AI SYSTEM CLASSIFICATION & REGULATORY CATEGORIZATION

**Confidential & Privileged**
**System Name:** AI Trust & Risk Operating System
**Regulatory Status:** Non-Autonomous / Advisory
**Risk Classification:** Tier 2 (Operational Decision Support)

---

## 1. Official System Categorization

For the purpose of Central Bank supervision and regulatory compliance, the AI Trust & Risk Operating System is legally and technically defined as a **Non-Autonomous Expert System**.

It functions strictly as an **Advisory Decision-Support Tool**, designed to enhance the analytical capacity of human compliance officers. It does not replace human judgment, nor does it possess the privileges to execute financial operations independently.

## 2. Operational Constraints (The "No Autonomy" Guarantee)

To clarify the limited scope of this system, we contrast it against the definition of "Autonomous AI" often cited in high-risk regulatory frameworks:

| Operational Dimension | "Autonomous AI" (Prohibited Scope) | AI Trust & Risk OS (Actual Scope) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decision Authority** | System makes final decisions and acts on them. | System provides **recommendations only**. Final decision is Human. |
| **Financial Execution** | Can authorize payments or freeze assets. | **Read-Only** access. **Zero** execution capability. |
| **Model Behavior** | Adaptive/Online Learning (evolves in production). | **Deterministic/Frozen**. Logic is static and version-controlled. |
| **Outcome Variability** | Probabilistic (outputs vary per run). | **Reproducible**. Same input always = Same output. |
| **Liability** | Ambiguous agency. | **Human-Held**. The human operator is the sole accountable legal entity. |

## 3. Human Final Authority

**The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) protocol is mandatory, not optional.**

> **Explicit Policy Statement:**
> "No algorithmic output from this system holds legal or financial force until it is explicitly reviewed, validated, and digitally signed by a qualified Human Officer. The AI provides the 'Draft'; the Human provides the 'Verdict'."

## 4. Risk Tier Justification

We submit that this system falls under **Model Risk Tier 2** (Important but Non-Critical Execution), rather than Tier 1 (Critical/Autonomous), based on the following:

1.  **Buffered Impact**: No immediate consumer harm is possible because the system cannot act. It buffers findings for review.
2.  **Fail-Safe Design**: In the event of system downtime or model failure, operations revert to standard manual review processes.
3.  **Explainability**: The system uses feature-weighting that allows auditors to trace exactly *why* a risk flag was raised (e.g., "Velocity > 3 std dev").

## 5. Conclusion on Suitability

This system is engineered to align with the **Precautionary Principle** of banking supervision. It leverages advanced data processing to detect financial crime risks (AML/Fraud) without introducing the operational risks associated with autonomous black-box agents.
