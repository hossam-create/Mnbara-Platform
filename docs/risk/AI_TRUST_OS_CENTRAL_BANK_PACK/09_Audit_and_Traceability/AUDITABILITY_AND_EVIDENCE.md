# AUDITABILITY, TRACEABILITY & EVIDENCE STANDARDS

**Confidential & Privileged**
**Subject:** Post-Hoc Reconstruction of AI Decisions
**Standard:** 100% Reproducibility of Regulatory Events

## 1. The "Black Box" Prohibition

The System is strictly engineered to avoid "Black Box" unexplainability. For every single output generated by the AI Risk Engine, the system must retain sufficient data to **reconstruct the decision logic exactly** up to 7 years later.

**Core Audit Principle:** *"If it isn't logged, it didn't happen - and we are liable."*

## 2. The Anatomy of an Audit Record

For every risk assessment event, an immutable **Atomic Audit Record (AAR)** is generated, containing four distinct layers of evidence:

### Layer 1: The Input Snapshot (The "State of the World")
We allow regulators to see exactly what the AI saw.
*   **Timestamp:** Precision to the millisecond (UTC).
*   **Raw Data:** The JSON payload received (e.g., Transaction Amount, Geo-IP, Device Fingerprint).
*   **Context:** Evaluation of User Tenure, Historical Velocity at that specific moment.

### Layer 2: The Model Configuration (The "Brain")
*   **Model Version:** SHA-256 Hash of the executable binary.
*   **Configuration ID:** Traceable pointer to the exact risk thresholds active (e.g., "Config_v2.1_HighRisk=85").
*   **Rule Set:** List of active deterministic rules (e.g., "Sanction_Check_Enabled=True").

### Layer 3: The Decision Output (The "Advice")
*   **Risk Score:** The raw probability score (0-100).
*   **Feature Contributions:** SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values indicating *why* the score is high (e.g., "+40 points due to Velocity; +10 points due to New Device").
*   **Triggered Flags:** Specific textual reasons (e.g., "Flag: Potential Structuring").

### Layer 4: The Outcome (The "Verdict")
*   **System Action:** "Hold for Review" vs. "Auto-Clear".
*   **Human Intervention:** (If applicable) Use ID of the officer, time of review, and free-text justification notes.
*   **Final Status:** "Approved" or "Rejected".

## 3. Immutable Logging Architecture

To ensure evidence cannot be tampered with:
*   **Write-Once:** Audit logs are pushed to a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) compliant storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3 Object Lock).
*   **Cryptographic Chaining:** Each day's logs are hashed and chained to the previous day's hash, creating an unbreakable "Blockchain-lite" verification of integrity.
*   **Separation:** System Admins have *no* delete permissions for Audit Buckets.

## 4. Evidence Export for Regulators

In response to a "Section 166" request or standard supervisory audit, the system can generate a **Certified Evidence Package**:

1.  **Select Scope:** (e.g., "All rejected transactions for User X in 2025").
2.  **Generate Report:** The system pulls the AARs from cold storage.
3.  **Human Readable:** JSON data is converted to a PDF "Case File" showing the timeline of analysis and decision.
4.  **Machine Readable:** Raw CSV/JSON export for the regulator's own data analysis teams.

## 5. Traceability Scenarios

| Scenario | Reconstructability |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Why was this legitimate user blocked?** | **Full.** We can see the exact spike in velocity or device mismatch that triggered the false positive. |
| **Why was this fraudster missed?** | **Full.** We can prove the fraudster's behavior was below the threshold set at that time (limiting liability) or identify a gap for retraining. |
| **Did the Risk Officer ignore the warning?** | **Full.** We log if the officer clicked "Overall AI" and the legally binding comment they typed. |
