# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: AI TRUST & RISK OPERATING SYSTEM

**confidential & privilieged**
**Date:** December 18, 2025
**To:** Central Bank Governor / Supervisory Committee
**Subject:** Operational Scope and Risk Classification of the AI Trust & Risk Operating System

---

## 1. Executive Overview

This document serves as a formal declaration of the operational boundaries, governance protocols, and risk classification of the **AI Trust & Risk Operating System** (the "System").

The System is strictly classified as a **Deterministic Decision-Support Tool**. It is engineered to assist human compliance officers and risk managers by aggregating data and flagging anomalies. It **does not** possess autonomous agency, decision-making authority, or independent execution capabilities.

## 2. System Classification & Operational Mandate

### 2.1 Non-Autonomous Nature
The System function is purely **advisory**. It operates on a "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) architecture where every critical output requires explicit human validation before any downstream effect occurs.

### 2.2 Deterministic Logic
Unlike generative models that probabalistically create content, this System utilizes **deterministic logic** for risk assessment. Given the same inputs, the System invariably produces the same risk score and compliance flag, ensuring auditability and reproducibility of all system outputs.

## 3. Explicit Operational Constraints (Negative Scope)

To ensure absolute alignment with Central Bank regulations regarding automated decision-making and financial stability, the System is subject to the following **Hard Operational Limits**:

1.  **NO Financial Execution**: The System has **zero** write-access to banking ledgers, payment gateways, or settlement systems. **No financial action is executed by the system.**
2.  **NO Account Freezing/Blocking**: The System cannot unilaterally freeze user accounts or block transactions. It can only issue a "Review Recommended" signal to a human analyst.
3.  **NO External Communication**: The System cannot communicate directly with customers or external regulators. All communications are routed through human-approved templates and channels.
4.  **NO Self-Evolution**: key model parameters and risk thresholds are static and can only be altered through a formal Change Management process approved by the Risk Committee.

## 4. Governance & Human Oversight

The System is wrapped in a "Review & Approve" governance layer:

*   **L1 (Automated Screening)**: The System aggregates data and calculates a preliminary risk score against pre-defined regulatory thresholds.
*   **L2 (Human Adjudication)**: A qualified human Officer reviews the System's findings. The human Officer retains full authority to accept, reject, or override the System's recommendation.
*   **L3 (Audit Trail)**: Every system signal and subsequent human decision is immutably logged to ensure full post-event reconstructability for regulatory audits.

## 5. Regulatory Alignment Statement

This infrastructure is designed to satisfy the prudential requirements for Model Risk Management and Technology Risk:

*   **Transparency**: No "Black Box" algorithms; all risk factors are explainable and traceable.
*   **Accountability**: Legal and operational liability remains strictly with human management; the AI is a tool, not a legal entity.
*   **Resilience**: The System operates in a fail-safe mode; if the AI component fails, operations default to manual processing, ensuring no disruption to critical banking services.

## 6. Conclusion

The AI Trust & Risk Operating System represents a conservative, risk-averse application of technology. By design, it acts solely as a sophisticated analytical lens for human experts, enhancing oversight capabilities without introducing autonomous operational risk.
