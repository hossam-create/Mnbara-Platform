# PAYMENT ADVISORY KILL SWITCHES

## 1. System Overview and Purpose

### 1.1 Kill Switch Framework Objective
This document defines the comprehensive kill switch framework for the payment advisory layer, ensuring immediate and complete shutdown capabilities across all system dimensions. The framework provides multiple layers of disablement to maintain absolute control over advisory operations.

### 1.2 Regulatory Compliance Alignment
All kill switch mechanisms are designed to meet or exceed regulatory requirements for financial advisory systems, providing immediate cessation capabilities without requiring external dependencies or third-party integrations.

## 2. Kill Switch Hierarchy and Authority

### 2.1 Authority Levels and Escalation Path
**Tier 1 - Operational Control:**
- Designated system administrators (2-person rule required)
- 24/7 coverage with 15-minute response SLA
- Immediate shutdown capability for individual features

**Tier 2 - Management Oversight:**
- Compliance officers and risk management personnel
- 4-hour response capability for corridor-level shutdown
- Approval required for broader system disablement

**Tier 3 - Executive Authority:**
- CISO and Chief Risk Officer
- Immediate global shutdown authority
- Bypass capability for all lower-level controls

**Tier 4 - Regulatory Override:**
- Pre-provisioned regulatory access channels
- Independent shutdown capability without system operator involvement
- Dedicated secure communication channels

### 2.2 Authentication and Authorization Requirements
**Multi-Factor Authentication:**
- Hardware token requirement for Tier 1-3 authorities
- Biometric verification for executive-level access
- Time-based one-time passwords for all access attempts
- Separate credential storage from operational systems

**Authorization Protocols:**
- Four-eyes principle for all kill switch activations
- Independent verification of authority before execution
- Complete audit trail of all authorization attempts
- Real-time notification to secondary authorities

## 4. Corridor-Level Shutdown

### 4.1 Geographic Segmentation
**Corridor Isolation Framework:**
- Independent kill switches per country pair combination
- Regional grouping capabilities (e.g., all EMEA corridors)
- Currency-based segmentation (e.g., USD-correlated corridors)
- Regulatory jurisdiction groupings

### 4.2 Shutdown Activation Criteria
**Automatic Trigger Conditions:**
- Regulatory change notifications from authorized sources
- Currency volatility exceeding predetermined thresholds
- Political instability indicators reaching critical levels
- Fraud pattern detection above acceptable limits
- System error rates exceeding service level agreements

### 4.3 Manual Activation Protocol
**Human Intervention Requirements:**
- Dual authorization from designated corridor managers
- Independent verification of shutdown justification
- Pre-defined escalation path for conflict resolution
- Complete documentation of shutdown rationale
- Regulatory notification within 1 business day

---

## 5. Global Advisory Shutdown

### 5.1 Complete System Disablement
**Global Kill Switch Capabilities:**
- Immediate cessation of all advisory functions
- Complete termination of all user-facing services
- Preservation of audit trails and system state
- Maintenance of security and monitoring functions
- Graceful degradation of non-advisory services

### 5.2 Activation Mechanisms
**Multiple Independent Channels:**
- Physical emergency shutdown buttons in secured locations
- Secure web interface with hardware token requirement
- API-based shutdown commands with multi-factor authentication
- SMS-based emergency shutdown codes
- Dedicated secure telephone hotline

### 5.3 Verification and Confirmation
**Activation Validation:**
- Independent confirmation of shutdown completion
- Real-time system status monitoring
- Automated notification to all authority levels
- External verification mechanisms
- Regulatory confirmation protocols

## 6. Manual Override Authority Mapping

### 6.1 Authority Matrix
**Clear Responsibility Mapping:**

| Authority Level | Feature Control | Corridor Shutdown | Global Shutdown | Override Capability |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Operational     | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No            | ❌ No                |
| Management      | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                |
| Executive       | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes               |
| Regulatory      | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes               |

### 6.2 Override Protocol
**Emergency Bypass Procedures:**
- Executive-level override requires written justification
- Regulatory override triggers immediate executive notification
- All overrides recorded in immutable audit logs
- Post-activation review within 24 hours
- Mandatory regulatory reporting for any override usage

### 6.3 Conflict Resolution
**Authority Dispute Resolution:**
- Pre-defined escalation path to CISO and Chief Risk Officer
- Independent arbitration committee for authority conflicts
- Emergency conference bridge activation procedures
- Regulatory liaison involvement for unresolved conflicts
