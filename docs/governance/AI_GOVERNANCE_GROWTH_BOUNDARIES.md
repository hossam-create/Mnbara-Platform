└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Rule | Description | Enforcement |

| **SAFE-003** | Kill switch executable in <5 minutes | SRE runbook |

### 2.4 Data Minimization Principle

## 6. REGULATORY CONTINUITY FRAMEWORK

### 6.1 Phase Transition Protocol
Before ANY phase transition:

1. **Stability Proof:** Previous phase stable for minimum period (6-18 months)
2. **Shadow Testing:** New capabilities tested in shadow mode (30+ days)
3. **Legal Review:** Updated Terms of Service / Privacy Policy
4. **Regulatory Filing:** Notification to relevant authorities (if required)
5. **Board Approval:** Unanimous CCB sign-off
6. **Rollout Plan:** Phased activation (1% → 10% → 100%)

### 6.2 Regulatory Inheritance
Each phase **inherits ALL constraints** from previous phases:

```
Phase 4 Constraints = Phase 4 + Phase 3 + Phase 2 + Phase 1 + Constitutional
```

No phase can remove or weaken a constraint from a lower phase.

### 6.3 Backward Compatibility
Disabling a higher phase leaves lower phases fully functional:

```
IF Phase 3 = DISABLED THEN
    Phase 2 = ACTIVE
    Phase 1 = ACTIVE
    Constitutional = ACTIVE
END IF
```
