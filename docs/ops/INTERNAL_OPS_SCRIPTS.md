|-------|-------------|
| "Unfortunately, per our policy..." | "We can't do that because..." |
| "I'm just following procedure" | "Here's why..." |
| "There's nothing I can do" | "Here's what I can do..." |
| "You should have..." | "Next time, try..." |
| "That's not my department" | "Let me get you to the right team" |
