- Emergency escalation protocols established and tested

---

## 2. Corridor Expansion Rules

### 2.1 Constraint Inheritance Protocol
All new corridors automatically inherit the complete constraint set from previously operational corridors, including:
- Identical trust verification requirements
- Same abandonment rate thresholds  
- Identical manual override protocols
- Equivalent audit trail standards
- Matching data retention policies (7+ years)

### 2.2 Risk Multiplier Framework (Read-Only)
**Corridor Risk Classification Matrix:**

| Risk Factor | Weight | Measurement |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Regulatory Complexity | 30% | Number of distinct regulatory bodies |
| Currency Volatility | 25% | 12-month standard deviation |
| Fraud History | 20% | Historical chargeback rates |
| Logistics Complexity | 15% | Customs clearance time variance |
| Cultural Distance | 10% | Hofstede cultural dimensions delta |

**Risk Multiplier Application:**
- Green Corridors (0.8-1.0x): Established markets with proven track records
- Yellow Corridors (1.1-1.5x): Moderate risk requiring enhanced monitoring
- Red Corridors (1.6-2.0x): High-risk markets requiring executive approval

### 2.3 Progressive Authorization Model
New corridors launch with 50% reduced volume caps for first 90 days, with weekly review cycles to validate:
- Trust metric stability
- Abandonment rate consistency  
- Manual override frequency
- Support ticket volume and resolution

---

## 3. Trust Threshold Carryover

### 3.1 Non-Negotiable Threshold Preservation
All trust and risk thresholds from initial market operation remain unchanged and non-negotiable:
- **KYC Completion Rate**: Minimum 85% (no degradation allowed)
- **Payment Abandonment**: Maximum 15% threshold (absolute ceiling)
- **Manual Override Frequency**: Maximum 5% of total transactions
- **Final Conversion Rate**: Minimum 8% floor (no exceptions)

### 3.2 Scaling Without Loosening Principle
**Strict Threshold Enforcement Protocol:**
1. New corridor performance metrics must meet OR EXCEED existing thresholds
2. No averaging across corridors - each evaluated independently
3. Weekly compliance audits against all threshold requirements
4. Immediate corridor suspension upon threshold violation

### 3.3 Escalation-Only Adjustments
Threshold modifications only permitted in escalation direction:
- **Tightening Allowed**: Increasing stringency based on risk assessment
- **Loosening Forbidden**: No degradation of existing protection standards
- **Emergency Override**: Only via unanimous executive risk committee approval

---

## 4. Ops Readiness Gates

### 4.1 Human Capacity Requirements
**Minimum Staffing Levels Before Market 1 Launch:**
- 3 trained human arbitrators per operational timezone
- 5 bilingual support agents for target market languages
- 2 dedicated compliance officers for regulatory monitoring
- 1 escalation manager available 24/7 with decision authority

### 4.2 Training and Certification Requirements
**Mandatory Completion Before Activation:**
- 40 hours of corridor-specific regulatory training
- Cultural competency certification for target markets
- Emergency scenario simulation completion (100% pass rate)
- Cross-border dispute resolution protocol certification

### 4.3 Infrastructure Readiness Verification
**Technical Prerequisites:**
- Real-time monitoring dashboard operational for new corridor
- All audit trails configured and tested
- Emergency kill switches installed and validated
- Data sovereignty compliance verified for both jurisdictions

---

## 5. Launch Authorization Checklist

### 5.1 GO Conditions (All Required)
- [ ] Regulatory compliance audit passed for both origin and destination
- [ ] All trust thresholds met or exceeded in 30-day pre-launch simulation

## 6. Audit & Regulator Continuity Statement

### 6.1 Regulatory Posture Preservation
SPRINT 4 expansion maintains identical regulatory compliance standards as initial launch:
- **No Reduction in Oversight**: All monitoring and reporting requirements preserved

1. **Constraint Inheritance**: New corridors inherit all existing compliance requirements
2. **Threshold Non-Negotiability**: No relaxation of trust or risk standards
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Additional oversight layers for new markets
4. **Conservative Scaling**: Volume-limited initial operation with progressive authorization

### 6.3 Regulatory Communication Protocol
