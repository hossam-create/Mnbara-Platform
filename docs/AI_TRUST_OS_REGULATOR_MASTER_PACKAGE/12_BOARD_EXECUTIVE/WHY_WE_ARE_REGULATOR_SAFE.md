# Why This AI System Is Regulator-Safe

### 1. The AI Does Not Act — Humans Do
*   AI provides recommendations only
*   No autonomous enforcement
*   Humans approve, override, or reject every critical outcome

### 2. The System Is Deterministic
*   Same input → same output
*   No online learning
*   No hidden behavior changes

### 3. Humans Are Actively Tested (Not Assumed)
*   Canary Tasks inject wrong AI outputs
*   Staff must detect and challenge AI
*   Automation bias is continuously measured and corrected

### 4. Accountability Is Explicit
*   Every decision has a named human owner
*   Justifications are mandatory
*   Full audit trail retained (7 years)

### 5. Oversight Exists Beyond Operations
*   Independent Risk & Compliance review
*   Authority to pause or shut down the system
*   Board-level AI Kill Switch in emergencies

**Bottom Line:**
This system reduces risk, increases transparency, and preserves human authority.
It is designed not just to **pass audits** — but to **survive them**.
