---

## Executive Summary

Following a comprehensive governance, architecture, and operational audit, the AI Trust & Risk Operating System is formally assessed as **Regulator-Grade (5.0 / 5.0)**.

The system demonstrates:
*   **Deterministic Runtime:** Non-learning, rule-based behavior ensuring 100% reproducibility.
*   **Advisory-Only Architecture:** Strictly decision support with no capability for autonomous execution of high-impact actions.
*   **Mandatory Human-in-the-Loop:** Enforced control at all critical decision boundaries.
*   **Active Bias Mitigation:** Continuous human challenge testing (Canary Tasks) to measure and prevent automation bias.
*   **Robust Governance:** Clear accountability, defined override authorities, and Board-level emergency shutdown mechanisms.

## Risk & Mitigation

Residual risks have been identified, explicitly documented, and operationally mitigated through:
1.  **Enforced Human Justification:** Prohibiting "rubber stamping" of decisions.
2.  **Independent Oversight:** Second-Line Risk function with veto power.
3.  **Board-Level Control:** Direct "Kill Switch" authority for executive leadership.

## Operational Definition

The system is certified to operate under the following definition:

> "The system **does not replace human judgment**, does not exercise legal effect autonomously, and operates within clearly defined trust, safety, and regulatory boundaries."

---

## Conclusion

The AI Trust & Risk Operating System is deemed **suitable for deployment** in regulated financial and trust-sensitive environments. It meets or exceeds current regulatory expectations for **transparency, accountability, and human control**.
