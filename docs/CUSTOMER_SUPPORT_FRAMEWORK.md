## 10 CANNED SUPPORT REPLIES

### 1. General Confusion / Platform Understanding
**Subject: Helping you understand how our platform works**

Hi [Name],

Thank you for reaching out. I understand this might be confusing at first.

Our platform is designed to help facilitate trusted connections between buyers and sellers. We provide advisory information and tools to help you make informed decisions, but we don't handle payments or execute transactions directly.

Would you like me to walk you through the specific area you're having trouble with?

Best regards,
[Support Team]

### 2. Transaction Delay Concern
**Subject: Checking on your transaction timeline**

Hi [Name],

I understand you're concerned about the timing of your transaction. 

Since we don't handle payments directly, the transaction pace depends on the payment method you and the other party agreed upon. Bank transfers typically take 1-3 business days, while escrow services might have their own processing timelines.

I can help you understand what to expect based on the payment method chosen. Would that be helpful?

Warmly,
[Support Team]

### 3. Dispute Assistance Offer
**Subject: Support with your transaction concern**

Hi [Name],

I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue with your transaction.

While we don't mediate disputes directly, we can help facilitate communication between both parties. Many misunderstandings can be resolved through clear conversation.

Would you like me to help you draft a message to the other party, or would you prefer to share more details about the situation?

We're here to help,
[Support Team]

### 4. Angry/Frustrated User
**Subject: I hear your frustration**

Hi [Name],

Thank you for sharing your concerns. I can see this situation is frustrating, and I appreciate you bringing it to our attention.

Let's work together to understand what happened and see how we can help moving forward. Even though we don't control the transaction execution, we can provide guidance and support.

Could you help me understand the specific issue you're facing?

Sincerely,
[Support Team]

### 5. Platform Limitation Explanation
**Subject: Understanding what we can help with**

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your message. I want to be transparent about how we can assist you.

Our role is to provide information and tools to help you make decisions, but we don't execute transactions or hold funds. This means we can't reverse payments or directly intervene in financial matters.

What we can do is provide guidance, help with communication, and offer information about next steps. How can I best support you within these parameters?

Best,
[Support Team]

### 6. Feature Request Acknowledgement
**Subject: Your suggestion has been received**

Thank you for taking the time to share your idea. We appreciate feedback from our community as it helps us improve.

I've documented your suggestion about [feature] and shared it with our product team. While we can't promise immediate implementation, all suggestions are reviewed regularly.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Gratefully,
[Support Team]

### 7. Payment Method Guidance
**Subject: Information about payment options**

Hi [Name],

Great question about payment methods. Here's some general information:

• **Escrow services**: Provide protection but may involve fees and longer processing
• **Bank transfers**: Lower fees but slower and less recourse options
• **Card payments**: Faster but higher fees and chargeback possibilities

We can help you understand the pros and cons of each option, but the choice and execution remain between you and the other party.

Would you like more specific information about any of these options?

Kind regards,
[Support Team]

### 8. Account Access Issue
**Subject: Helping you access your account**

Hi [Name],

I'm sorry you're having trouble accessing your account. Let's get this sorted out.

For security reasons, I'll need to verify your identity before assisting with account access. Could you please provide [specific verification information]?

Once verified, I can help you regain access or guide you through the self-service options.

Thank you for your patience,
[Support Team]

### 9. Positive Feedback Response
**Subject: Thank you for your kind words!**

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your positive experience. Feedback like yours truly makes our day and helps us understand what's working well.

I've shared your comments with the rest of the team – it means a lot to know we're helping create positive experiences.

Is there anything else we can do to support you?

With appreciation,
[Support Team]

### 10. Follow-up Check-in
**Subject: Checking in on your situation**

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation about [issue]. How are things progressing?
