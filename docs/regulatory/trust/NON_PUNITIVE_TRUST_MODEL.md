┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   TRUST SCORES INFORM. THEY DO NOT PUNISH.                 │
│                                                             │
│   The purpose of the Trust System is to help users make    │
│   informed decisions, NOT to punish past behavior or       │
│   create permanent disadvantage.                            │

│   Every user can rebuild trust. No user is permanently     │
│   locked out based solely on trust score.                  │
│                                                             │

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Informational, Not Punitive

| Principle | Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scores inform decisions** | Users see trust to make choices |
| **Scores do not block access** | Low score ≠ banned |
| **Scores do not determine pricing** | No trust-based price discrimination |
| **Scores do not affect service quality** | Same support for all users |

### 2.2 Proportional Consequences

| Principle | Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Response matches severity** | Minor issue → minor impact |
| **Escalation is graduated** | Warning → limitation → restriction |
| **Maximum impact is bounded** | No permanent exclusion for non-fraud |
| **Recovery path exists** | Every restriction has an exit |

### 2.3 Human Review Supremacy

| Principle | Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Algorithm advises** | Score is input, not decision |
| **Human decides** | All restrictions require human review |
| **Appeal exists** | Every decision can be challenged |
| **Override possible** | Authorized humans can override system |

---

## 3. Prohibited Punitive Practices

### 3.1 Absolutely Prohibited

The Trust System **SHALL NOT**:

| Prohibited Practice | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| Permanent score lock | Rehabilitation principle |
| Single-event permanent ban (non-fraud) | Proportionality |
| Trust-based price increases | Discrimination |
| Hidden score penalties | Transparency |
| Punitive display (public shaming) | Dignity |
| Score-based customer service tiers | Equal treatment |
| Automatic action without human review | Human supremacy |

### 3.2 Conditionally Prohibited

| Practice | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Extended restriction | Requires quarterly human review |
| Score below minimum threshold | Requires review within 30 days |
| Repeated limitation | Requires escalation to manager |

---

## 4. Proportionality Framework

### 4.1 Issue Severity Classification

| Severity | Examples | Maximum Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minor** | Late response, minor delay | Warning only |
| **Moderate** | Dispute lost, partial issue | Temporary limitation |
| **Serious** | Multiple disputes, significant harm | Extended limitation |
| **Severe** | Fraud, safety violation | Account restriction |

### 4.2 Response Escalation Ladder

**Stage 1: Education**
```
Issue: First minor problem
Response: Educational message
Impact on Score: Minimal
Recovery: Immediate upon acknowledgment
```

**Stage 2: Warning**
```
Issue: Repeated minor OR first moderate problem
Response: Formal warning + guidance
Impact on Score: Minor temporary decrease
Recovery: 30-90 days of good behavior
```

**Stage 3: Limitation**
```
Issue: Repeated moderate OR first serious problem
Response: Feature limitation (e.g., transaction cap)
Impact on Score: Moderate decrease
Recovery: Human review after 90 days
```

**Stage 4: Restriction**
```
Issue: Repeated serious OR severe problem
Response: Significant restriction
Impact on Score: Significant decrease
Recovery: Appeal process required
Human Review: Mandatory within 7 days
```

**Stage 5: Suspension** (Non-Fraud)
```
Issue: Escalated from Stage 4
Response: Account suspension
Impact on Score: N/A (suspended)
Recovery: Appeal to Trust Review Board
Human Review: Mandatory
Maximum Duration: 1 year (review required)
```

### 4.3 Fraud-Specific Path

```
Confirmed fraud bypasses escalation ladder.

Response: Immediate suspension
Review: Mandatory within 48 hours
Duration: Indefinite pending investigation
Recovery: Appeal to Trust Review Board only
```
