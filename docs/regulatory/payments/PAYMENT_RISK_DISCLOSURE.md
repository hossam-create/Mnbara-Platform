**Effective Date:** December 19, 2025

- Protection scope and limitations

---

## 2. Cross-Border Risk Disclosures

### 2.1 Mandatory Cross-Border Notice

When transaction involves different countries:

```
CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTION NOTICE

This is an international transaction. Please understand:

CUSTOMS & DUTIES
• Your country may charge import duties or taxes
• These fees are your responsibility, not the seller's
• Delivery may be delayed for customs processing

DELIVERY RISKS
• International delivery takes longer (typically 2-4 weeks)
• Tracking may be limited in some regions
• Delivery address errors are difficult to correct

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
• Disputes may be subject to laws of the seller's country
• Resolution may take longer than domestic transactions
• Some protections may not apply internationally

CURRENCY
• Payment may be converted at your bank's rate
• Exchange rates fluctuate; final amount may differ
• Your bank may charge conversion fees

By proceeding, you acknowledge these risks.
```

### 2.2 High-Risk Corridor Disclosure

For corridors with elevated risk:

```
ELEVATED RISK NOTICE

Transactions to [Country/Region] have additional considerations:

• [Specific risk factor 1]
• [Specific risk factor 2]
• Delivery confirmation may be limited

We recommend using escrow protection for this transaction.
```

### 2.3 Restricted Region Disclosure

For regions with service limitations:

```
SERVICE LIMITATIONS

Due to regulatory or operational constraints, transactions 
to [Region] have the following limitations:

• [Limitation 1]
• [Limitation 2]

These limitations are outside our control. Proceeding means
you accept these constraints.
```

## 3. Chargeback Risk Disclosures

### 3.1 Chargeback Rights Explanation

```
CHARGEBACK INFORMATION

If you pay by card, you may have chargeback rights through 
your card issuer. Important things to know:

CHARGEBACK RIGHTS VARY
• Rights depend on your card type and issuer
• Not all transactions are eligible
• International transactions may have different rules

CHARGEBACK LIMITS
• Most issuers require filing within 60-120 days
• Your issuer makes the final decision, not us
• The process typically takes 30-90 days

CHARGEBACK IS NOT GUARANTEED
• Your issuer may deny your dispute
• Some transaction types have limited protections
• Using chargeback improperly may affect your account

If you use Platform Escrow, disputes are handled by us
directly, typically within 72 hours.
```

### 3.2 Low-Protection Payment Warning

When user selects less-protected payment method:

```
LIMITED DISPUTE PROTECTION

You have chosen [Payment Method].

This payment method has LIMITED dispute options:

• Transactions are difficult to reverse
• Chargeback rights may not apply
• You may not be able to recover funds if issues arise

Before proceeding, consider:
• Are you confident in this transaction?
• Would Escrow or Card provide better protection?
