## 4. Experiment Evaluation Criteria

### 4.1 Permissibility Test Questions
**Mandatory Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Does this experiment touch any financial systems? ❌
2. Does this affect trust or risk scoring? ❌
3. Could this be perceived as deceptive? ❌
4. Does this reduce user control or choice? ❌
5. Might this impact regulatory compliance? ❌
6. Does this modify safety protocols? ❌
7. Is this purely UX/educational? ✅
8. Does this improve clarity? ✅
9. Is this non-deceptive? ✅
10. Does this preserve user autonomy? ✅

### 4.2 Risk Assessment Matrix
**Experiment Risk Classification:**

| Risk Factor | Weight | Assessment Criteria |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
