upfront: we're early stage, and I want to make sure we're 
actually a good fit for what you need."

Understanding (5 min):
- "What are you trying to accomplish?"
- "What have you tried before?"
- "What's most important to you?"

## Phase 3: Sustainable Growth (Weeks 13-24)

### Influencer Engagement Process

**Objective:** Partner with authentic voices who align with trust-first values.

```
INFLUENCER VETTING PROCESS:
───────────────────────────
Step 1: Initial Screen
□ Authentic engagement (not bought followers)
□ History of honest reviews
□ Audience matches our users
□ No history of undisclosed sponsorships

Step 2: Values Alignment Call
□ Explain our trust-first approach
□ Share what they CAN'T say
□ Confirm they're comfortable with limitations
□ Discuss negative experience clause

Step 3: Trial Collaboration
□ Provide free service (no payment yet)
□ Ask for honest feedback privately first
□ If negative, thank them and don't proceed
□ If positive, discuss paid partnership

INFLUENCER BRIEF TEMPLATE:
─────────────────────────
"We're different from typical brand partnerships:

1. You MUST disclose this is paid (#Ad, first line)
2. You MUST mention at least one limitation
3. You CAN'T make financial promises
4. You CAN'T use urgency language
5. If your experience is negative, you can:
   - Not post (we still pay you)
   - Post honestly (we still pay you)

We review for accuracy only, not sentiment.
Your honest opinion is more valuable than praise."

## Summary: The Trust-First Mindset

```
BEFORE EVERY GROWTH DECISION, ASK:

1. Is this honest?
   - No exaggeration
   - No omission of important facts
   - No misleading implications

2. Is this respectful?
   - No manipulation
   - No pressure
   - No exploitation of emotions

3. Is this sustainable?
   - Would this work at 10x scale?
   - Would we be proud of this in 5 years?
   - Does this build or erode trust?

4. Is this necessary?
   - Does this serve users or just metrics?
   - Would users thank us for this?
   - Is there a more honest alternative?

If any answer is "no" or "maybe," don't do it.
