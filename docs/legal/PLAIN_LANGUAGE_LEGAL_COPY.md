## 1. Terms of Service

### Opening

**Before (Legal):**
> By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site.

**After (Plain Language):**
> Welcome to MNBARA. These are the rules for using our platform. We've tried to make them clear and fair. If something doesn't make sense, ask us.

---

### Account Registration

**Before (Legal):**
> To use certain features of our platform, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information, maintain the security of your account credentials, notify us immediately of any unauthorized access, and be responsible for all activities under your account.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Your Account**

When you create an account, we need a few things from you:

- **Be honest** — Use your real information. We need this to keep everyone safe.
- **Keep your password safe** — Don't share it. If someone else uses your account, you're responsible for what happens.
- **Tell us if something's wrong** — If you think someone got into your account, let us know right away. We'll help you fix it.

---

### Marketplace Rules

**Before (Legal):**
> As a user of our marketplace, you agree to list only items you have the right to sell, provide accurate descriptions of items, honor all completed transactions, not engage in fraudulent or deceptive practices, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Selling on MNBARA**

If you're selling something:

- **Only sell what's yours** — Don't list items you don't own or can't legally sell.
- **Be accurate** — Describe items honestly. If there's a scratch, say so. Photos should show the real item.
- **Follow through** — If someone buys from you, ship it. Backing out hurts everyone.
- **Play fair** — No fake listings, no misleading descriptions, no tricks.

If you're buying:

- **Pay for what you buy** — When you commit to a purchase, follow through.
- **Communicate** — If there's an issue, talk to the seller first. Most problems can be solved with a conversation.

---

### Auction Rules

**Before (Legal):**
> When participating in auctions, all bids are binding commitments to purchase. Bid manipulation or shill bidding is prohibited. Winners must complete payment within 48 hours. Sellers must ship within the stated timeframe.

**After (Plain Language):**

**How Auctions Work**

- **Bids are real commitments** — When you bid, you're saying "I'll buy this at this price." Don't bid if you don't mean it.
- **No fake bidding** — Don't bid on your own items or have friends bid to drive up prices. We can tell, and we'll remove you from the platform.
- **Winners pay within 48 hours** — If you win, complete your payment within 2 days.
- **Sellers ship on time** — When your item sells, ship it within the timeframe you promised.

---

### Crowdshipping

**Before (Legal):**
> For travelers participating in crowdshipping, complete KYC verification is required. You must comply with all customs regulations. Delivery evidence must be provided. Escrow funds are released upon confirmed delivery.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Crowdshipping (Travelers Helping Shoppers)**

If you're a traveler delivering items:

- **Verify your identity first** — We need to confirm who you are before you can deliver. This protects everyone.
- **Know the customs rules** — Different countries have different rules about what you can bring in. It's your responsibility to know them.
- **Take photos** — When you deliver, take a photo as proof. This protects you if there's ever a question.
- **Payment comes after delivery** — We hold the money safely until the buyer confirms they got their item. Then you get paid.

---

### Payments and Fees

**Before (Legal):**
> MNBARA charges fees for certain services. All fees are disclosed before transactions. Payment processing is handled securely through our approved payment providers.

**After (Plain Language):**

**What It Costs**

- **We show you fees upfront** — Before you complete any transaction, you'll see exactly what you're paying. No surprises.
- **Your payment is secure** — We use trusted payment providers to keep your money safe.
- **We take a small cut** — That's how we keep the platform running. The exact amount depends on the transaction type, and we always show it before you pay.

---

### Dispute Resolution

**Before (Legal):**
> In case of disputes between buyers and sellers, MNBARA provides a resolution process. Our decisions in dispute cases are final and binding.

**After (Plain Language):**

**If Something Goes Wrong**

We hope every transaction goes smoothly, but sometimes things don't work out.

- **Talk first** — Try to work it out with the other person. Most issues are misunderstandings.
- **We're here to help** — If you can't resolve it, open a dispute. We'll look at both sides and make a fair decision.
- **Our decision is final** — We do our best to be fair, but we can't keep going back and forth forever. Once we decide, that's the answer.

---

### Limitation of Liability

**Before (Legal):**
> MNBARA is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the platform. Our total liability is limited to the fees you have paid to us.

**After (Plain Language):**

**What We're Responsible For**

Let's be honest about what we can and can't do:

- **We're a marketplace, not a guarantee** — We connect buyers and sellers, but we can't control what every person does.
- **We're not responsible for everything** — If something goes wrong that we couldn't have prevented, we can't cover all the costs.
- **We'll make it right when we can** — If we mess up, we'll refund the fees you paid us. That's the most we can offer.

We're not trying to avoid responsibility—we just want to be clear about what's realistic.

---

---

## 3. Data Consent

### Essential Data

**Before (Legal):**
> Required for core platform functionality including account management, transactions, and security.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Essential Data** (Required)

This is the minimum we need to run the platform:
- Your account info
- Transaction records
- Security logs

Without this, the app can't work. That's why it's required.

---

### Analytics

**Before (Legal):**
> Help us improve the platform by sharing anonymous usage data and crash reports.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Analytics** (Optional)

This helps us understand:
- Which features people use
- Where the app crashes
- What's confusing

It's anonymous—we see patterns, not individuals. Turn it off if you prefer.

---

### Personalization

**Before (Legal):**
> Allow us to personalize your feed, recommendations, and search results based on your activity.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Personalization** (Optional)

This lets us:
- Show you items you might like
- Remember your preferences
- Make search results more relevant

If you turn this off, you'll see the same thing as everyone else.

---

### Marketing

**Before (Legal):**
> Receive promotional emails, special offers, and updates about new features.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Marketing Emails** (Optional)

We'll send you:
- Special deals
- New feature announcements
- Tips for using the platform

Usually 1-2 emails per week, max. Unsubscribe anytime with one click.

---

## 4. Escrow Explanation

**Before (Legal):**
> Funds are held in escrow pending successful completion of the transaction and confirmation of delivery by the buyer. Release of funds is subject to the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement.

**After (Plain Language):**

**How Payment Protection Works**

1. **Buyer pays** — Money goes into a secure holding account (not to the seller yet)
2. **Seller/Traveler delivers** — Item gets shipped and delivered
3. **Buyer confirms** — Buyer says "yes, I got it"
4. **Seller gets paid** — Money is released to the seller

If something goes wrong, the money is still safe while we figure it out.

---

## 5. Refund Policy

**Before (Legal):**
> Refunds are subject to the terms of the original transaction and may be issued at the sole discretion of MNBARA following investigation of the dispute. Processing times may vary.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Refunds**

- **Item never arrived?** — Full refund
- **Item not as described?** — Full or partial refund depending on the situation
- **Changed your mind?** — Depends on the seller's policy (check before buying)
- **How long?** — Usually 3-5 business days back to your original payment method

If you're not sure, just ask. We'll explain your options.

---

## 6. Account Termination

**Before (Legal):**
> MNBARA reserves the right to terminate or suspend your account at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the platform will immediately cease.

**After (Plain Language):**

**Account Suspension or Closure**

We might close your account if you:
- Break the rules repeatedly
- Commit fraud
- Harass other users
- Do something illegal

We'll usually warn you first, unless it's serious. If we close your account:
- You can't use the platform anymore
- Pending transactions will be handled fairly
- You can appeal if you think we made a mistake

---

## 7. Changes to Terms

**Before (Legal):**
> We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Your continued use of the platform following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

**After (Plain Language):**

**If We Change These Rules**

Sometimes we need to update these terms. When we do:
- We'll email you about important changes
- We'll give you time to review before they take effect
- If you don't agree, you can close your account

We won't make changes that hurt you without good reason.

---

## Quick Reference: Tone Transformation

| Legal Tone | Plain Language |
|------------|----------------|
| "Failure to comply will result in termination" | "If you break these rules, we might close your account" |
| "You hereby grant us a license" | "You're giving us permission to" |
| "We disclaim all warranties" | "We can't promise everything will be perfect" |
| "You shall indemnify us" | "If we get in trouble because of something you did, you'll help cover the costs" |
| "Subject to applicable law" | "As the law requires" |
| "At our sole discretion" | "We'll decide" |
| "Without limitation" | (Just remove it) |
| "Including but not limited to" | "Like" or "Such as" |

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers

When displaying legal text in the app:
- Use the plain-language versions from this document
- Keep a link to the full legal version for those who want it
- Use expandable sections for longer explanations
- Add tooltips for any remaining technical terms

### For Legal Review

These plain-language versions should be reviewed by legal counsel to ensure they:
- Maintain legal enforceability
- Cover all required disclosures
- Comply with regional regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

The goal is clarity without losing protection.
