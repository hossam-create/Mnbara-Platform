# Public Trust Statement: How We Use AI for Safety & Risk

**Effective Date:** December 2025
**Applicability:** Mnbara Platform & AI Trust Operating System

---

## 1. What This System Is

At Mnbara, we use advanced technology to keep our marketplace safe, secure, and fair. Our **AI Trust & Risk Operating System** is a **Decision Support Tool** designed to assist our human Trust & Safety teams.

Its primary function is to **analyze** high volumes of transaction data in real-time to identify potential risks such as fraud, policy violations, or suspicious activity. It provides a **recommendation** (e.g., "Review for Safety") to help our team make faster, better-informed decisions.

## 2. What This System Is NOT

It is important to clarify the limitations of our system to ensure transparency:

*   **It is NOT an Autonomous Decision Maker:** The system does not have the authority to unilaterally execute critical legal or financial actions (such as permanently banning a user or seizing funds) without human oversight.
*   **It is NOT Infinite or "Black Box":** We do not use generative AI or unexplainable models for risk decisions. The logic is based on strict, predefined rules created by human experts.
*   **It Does NOT Move Money:** The risk system is strictly isolated from our financial ledger. It cannot authorize transfers, withdrawals, or refunds.

## 3. Human Oversight & Accountability

We believe in **Human-in-the-Loop** governance. Technology is a tool, but humans are accountable.

*   **Final Authority:** All high-impact decisions (such as account suspensions) require confirmation by a trained Trust & Safety specialist.
*   **Override Capability:** Our human agents always have the authority to disagree with and override a system recommendation if they believe it is incorrect.
*   **Accountability:** We log all decisions. If a mistake is made, we can trace exactly why it happened—whether it was a system flag or a human error—and correct it.

## 4. Fairness & Explainability

We are committed to using technology that is fair and transparent.

*   **Deterministic Logic:** Our system uses consistent, rule-based logic. This means that if two different users perform the exact same action under the exact same conditions, the system will treat them exactly the same way.
*   **No Hidden Factors:** We do not use "black box" algorithms that cannot be explained. For every recommendation the system makes, we can generate a clear explanation of *why* (e.g., "Flagged due to unusual login location").
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** We actively monitor our system to ensure it performs consistently across all user groups and does not develop unintended biases.

## 5. Data Use & Privacy

We treat your data with the highest level of care and respect.

*   **Minimization:** The system only processes the data that is strictly necessary to assess risk (such as transaction details and device security signals).
*   **No Sensitive Profiling:** We do not use data regarding race, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs in our risk scoring models.
*   **Legal Compliance:** Our data retention and processing practices are fully aligned with applicable laws, including GDPR and financial regulations (AML).

## 6. Our Commitment to You

We deploy this technology to **protect** our community, not to police it unfairly. We are committed to:
1.  **Transparency** about how we use technology.
2.  **Accountability** for every decision we make.
3.  **Responsiveness** if you believe a mistake has been made.

If you have questions about a decision affecting your account, our support team is available to provide a human review.
