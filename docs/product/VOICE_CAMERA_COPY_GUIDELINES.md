### Tone Guidelines

| Context | Tone | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Before capture | Inviting, optional | "You can speak or type—your choice." |
| During capture | Reassuring, clear | "Listening... tap Stop when you're done." |
| After capture | Transparent, editable | "Here's what we heard. Edit anything." |
| Suggestions | Humble, uncertain | "We think this might be... please verify." |
| Errors | Helpful, calm | "We couldn't hear that clearly. Try again?" |

## 2. Voice Feature Copy

### 2.1 Invitation to Use Voice

**Primary CTA:**
```
🎤 Speak your request

Describe what you're looking for out loud. 
We'll turn it into a search.
```

**Alternative (shorter):**
```
[ 🎤 Speak ] or [ ⌨️ Type ]
```

**Why Not "Talk to us":**
- "Talk to us" implies conversation/AI personality
- "Speak your request" is functional and clear

---

### 2.2 During Recording

**Recording Active:**
```
🔴 Listening...

Describe your item. Tap Stop when you're done.
```

**Live Transcript:**
```
🔴 "I'm looking for a black iPhone 15..."

[ ⬛ Stop ]
```

**Long Recording Warning (>30 seconds):**
```
Tip: Shorter descriptions work best. 
Tap Stop when you've described the key details.
```

---

### 2.3 After Recording

**Success - Transcript Shown:**
```
✓ Got it!

You said:
"I'm looking for a black iPhone 15 Pro Max with 256GB 
from the Apple Store in New York"

[ 🔊 Play back ]  [ ✏️ Edit ]  [ 🗑️ Delete and retry ]
```

**Processing:**
```
⏳ Understanding your request...

This usually takes a few seconds.
```

**Parsed Result:**
```
We understood:

📱 iPhone 15 Pro Max
💾 256GB
⚫ Black
📍 Apple Store, NYC

Does this look right?

[ ✓ Yes, search ]  [ ✏️ Edit ]  [ 🔄 Try again ]
```

### 2.4 Voice Error Messages

**Couldn't Hear:**

We couldn't hear that clearly.

This might help:

• Hold the phone closer

[ 🎤 Try again ]  [ ⌨️ Type instead ]
```

**Too Short:**
```
That was very short.

Try adding more detail, like:
"iPhone 15 Pro, black, 256GB, from NYC"

[ 🎤 Try again ]  [ ⌨️ Type instead ]
```

**No Speech Detected:**
```
We didn't detect any speech.

Make sure your microphone is working and try again.

[ 🎤 Try again ]  [ ⌨️ Type instead ]
```

**Language Not Supported:**
```
We had trouble with that language.

We currently support English best. 
You can also type your request.

```
