## 2. Allowed Copy Patterns

### 2.1 Educational Copy

**Purpose:** Help users understand concepts.

**Pattern:**
```
[Simple statement]
[What it means for you]
[Where to learn more]
```

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
Your payment goes to escrow first.

This means the traveler doesn't get paid until you confirm 
you've received your item.

[Learn how escrow protects you →]
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Trust scores show verified history.

A higher score means more completed transactions and 
verified credentials.

[How trust scores work →]
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
Smart buyers use escrow!
Don't risk losing your money.
[Use escrow now →]
```

---

### 2.2 Explanatory Copy

**Purpose:** Clarify what users are looking at.

**Pattern:**
```
[What you're seeing]
[Why it matters]
```

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
This is your Intent Chip.

It shows how we understood your request. 
Tap any part to edit it.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Fee breakdown

Here's where your payment goes:
• Item price: $1,199
• Traveler fee: $150
• Platform fee: $33.73
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
We found the BEST deal for you!
Only 2 travelers available — act fast!
```

---

### 2.3 Comparison Copy

**Purpose:** Help users weigh options neutrally.

**Pattern:**
```
[Option A]: [Neutral description]
[Option B]: [Neutral description]
[No recommendation]
```

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
Escrow: Payment held until you confirm delivery.
Card: Standard card payment with chargeback rights.

Both options are available. Choose what works for you.
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Sarah M: 47 trips, 4.9 rating, 2 years on platform
Ahmed K: 12 trips, 4.2 rating, 6 months on platform

Review profiles to decide who fits your needs.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
Escrow: ★★★★★ RECOMMENDED — Maximum protection!
Card: ★★★☆☆ Less safe, but faster

Most users choose escrow. You should too!
```

---

### 2.4 Warning Copy

**Purpose:** Alert users to important information without fear.

**Pattern:**
```
[What to know]
[What it means]
[What you can do]
```

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
This is a high-value transaction.

For purchases over $500, you might want extra protection.
Escrow holds your payment until you confirm delivery.

[See protection options]
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Bank transfers have limited dispute options.

If something goes wrong, it may be difficult to 
recover your funds.

[See other payment methods]   [Continue with bank transfer]
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
⚠️ DANGER! You could lose your money!
Bank transfers are RISKY!
Are you REALLY sure about this?!
```

## 3. Forbidden Copy Patterns

### 3.1 Urgency Language

| Forbidden | Why | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Only 2 left!" | Creates artificial scarcity | "2 travelers available on this route" |
| "Act fast!" | Pressures decision | "Take your time to decide" |
| "Limited time!" | Artificial urgency | [Remove entirely] |
| "Don't miss out!" | FOMO manipulation | [Remove entirely] |
| "Hurry!" | Pressure tactic | [Remove entirely] |

### 3.2 Social Proof Manipulation

| Forbidden | Why | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Most people choose X" | Influences choice | "Here are your options" |
| "Recommended by 95% of users" | Statistical manipulation | [Remove entirely] |
| "The smart choice" | Implies other choices are dumb | "One option is..." |
| "Trusted by thousands" | Vague social proof | Specific: "47 completed transactions" |

### 3.3 Fear-Based Language

| Forbidden | Why | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Protect yourself!" | Fear tactic | "Your payment is protected by escrow" |
| "Don't risk it!" | Fear tactic | "Here's how protection works" |
| "Danger!" | Excessive alarm | "Something to know" |
| "You could lose everything" | Exaggeration | "Limited dispute options available" |

### 3.4 Manipulative Comparisons

| Forbidden | Why | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bigger button for preferred option | Visual manipulation | Equal-sized buttons |
| Greyed-out "dismiss" | Makes dismissal hard | Equal prominence |
| Hiding the "no thanks" option | Force acceptance | Clear, equal alternatives |
| "Basic" vs "Premium" labels | Implies hierarchy | Neutral labels |

## 4. A/B Test Copy Variants

### 4.1 What Can Be Tested

| Element | Allowed Variants | Not Allowed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Headline | Clarity variations | Persuasion variations |
| Explanation | Length, structure | Spin, emphasis |
| CTA button | Neutral wording variations | Action-pushing variations |
| Error messages | Helpfulness variations | Blame/shame variations |

### 4.2 Example: Escrow Explanation Test

**Hypothesis:** Shorter explanation may improve comprehension.

**Control (Current):**
```
Platform Escrow protects your payment.

When you pay through escrow, your money is held securely 
until you confirm that you've received your item and it 
matches your expectations. Only then is the traveler paid.

If something goes wrong, you can request a refund through 
our dispute process.
```

**Variant A (Shorter):**
```
Your money is held until you confirm delivery.

Pay → We hold → You receive → You confirm → Traveler paid

[See full details]
```

**Variant B (Visual):**
```
How escrow protects you:

1. 💳 You pay → money held safely
2. ✈️ Traveler delivers your item
3. ✅ You confirm → traveler gets paid

If there's a problem, you get your money back.
```

**Measurement:** Comprehension score, time to understand, support tickets.

---

### 4.3 Example: Trust Explanation Test

**Hypothesis:** Different trust labels may be clearer.

**Control:**
```
💚 HIGH TRUST
```

**Variant A:**
```
✅ HIGHLY VERIFIED
```

**Variant B:**
```
⭐ ESTABLISHED (47 trips)
```

**Variant C:**
```
🛡️ STRONG HISTORY
```

**Measurement:** User understanding of what trust means, click-through on explanation.

## 7. Tone Calibration

### Education Screens
**Tone:** Friendly teacher

```
"Let's walk through how this works..."
"Here's what happens when you..."
"This means that..."
```

### Decision Screens
**Tone:** Neutral facilitator

```
"Here are your options..."
"You can choose..."
"Both options are available..."
```

### Warning Screens
**Tone:** Calm advisor

```
"Here's something to know..."
"Before you proceed..."
"You might want to consider..."
```

### Confirmation Screens
**Tone:** Clear summarizer

```
"You're about to..."
"Here's what will happen..."
"Once you confirm..."
```

---

## 8. Cultural Considerations

### Language Variations (for localization)
- Avoid idioms that don't translate literally
- Avoid humor (translates poorly)
- Avoid sports/cultural metaphors
- Be explicit about currency and dates

### Regional Sensitivity
- Avoid assumptions about payment access (not everyone has cards)
- Avoid assumptions about banking hours (time zones)
- Respect different trust norms (face-to-face cultures vs. online-first)
