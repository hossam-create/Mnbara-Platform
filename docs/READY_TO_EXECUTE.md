## 🎯 The Strategy in 30 Seconds

**Old Approach:** Execute tasks 1→2→3→4... sequentially = 12 weeks

**New Approach:** Execute by dependency order = 4 weeks

**Critical Path:**
```
Week 1-2: Task 22 (Database) → Task 24 (API) → Task 19 (Auth)
Week 3-4: Task 20 (Payments) + Task 2 (Products) + Task 1 (Checkout) + Task 23 (Auctions)
Week 5-6: Web & Mobile UX features (parallel)
Week 7-8: KYC, Admin, Compliance
```

**Result:** Functional marketplace with web, mobile, auctions, payments, and admin in 4 weeks.
